# Interactive Navigation Menu

This project implements a responsive, fixed position navigation menu with interactive features.

## Features

-   **Fixed Position**: The navigation bar stays at the top of the screen while scrolling.
-   **Glassmorphism Effect**: The navbar uses a backdrop blur effect that becomes more pronounced when scrolling.
-   **Scroll Interaction**: The navbar style changes (height shrinks, background darkens) when the user scrolls down.
-   **Hover Effects**: Menu links feature an animated underline effect on hover.
-   **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking on navigation links smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section.

## Files

-   `index.html`: The main HTML structure.
-   `style.css`: Contains all the styling, animations, and responsive design rules.
-   `script.js`: Handles the scroll event listeners to toggle navigation states.

## How to Run

1.  Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  Scroll down the page to observe the navigation bar transformation.
3.  Hover over the menu items to see the animations.
